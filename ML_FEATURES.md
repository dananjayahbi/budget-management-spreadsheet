## ü§ñ Financial Prediction System

### What It Does
The ML prediction system analyzes your current and previous month's financial data to:
- **Predict if you can survive the current month** financially
- Calculate **daily spending averages** for expenses and income
- Project your **month-end balance** based on current trends
- Provide a **confidence score** (0-100%) based on data availability
- Compare trends between current and previous months

### How It Works

#### 1. Data Collection
- Gathers all transactions from the **current month** (up to today)
- Gathers all transactions from the **previous month** (full month)

#### 2. Daily Average Calculation
```
Daily Avg Expense = Total Current Month Expenses / Days Elapsed
Daily Avg Income = Total Current Month Income / Days Elapsed
```

#### 3. Projection
```
Projected Remaining Expenses = Daily Avg Expense √ó Days Remaining
Projected Remaining Income = Daily Avg Income √ó Days Remaining
Projected End Balance = Current Balance + Projected Income - Projected Expenses
```

#### 4. Confidence Score
- Based on **days of data** available
- More days = higher confidence
- Formula: `min(days_elapsed / 15 * 100, 100)`
- 15+ days of data = 100% confidence

#### 5. Survival Prediction
- **Can Survive**: Projected end balance ‚â• $0
- **Cannot Survive**: Projected end balance < $0

## üí° How to Use

### Step 1: Add Your Transactions
Go to the **Expenses** tab and add:
- Income transactions (salary, etc.)
- Expense transactions (bills, shopping, etc.)
- Use date filters to view different periods

### Step 2: View Analytics
Switch to the **Analytics** tab to see:
1. **ML Prediction** at the top showing survival prediction
2. **Trend charts** showing 6-month history
3. **Statistics** and insights below

### Step 3: Interpret Results

#### Good Financial Health ‚úÖ
- Green prediction card
- Projected balance > $0
- Income line above expense line in charts
- High confidence score (>75%)

#### Warning Signs ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Red prediction card
- Projected balance < $0
- Expense line above income line
- Budget exceeded alerts in insights

### Step 4: Take Action
Based on predictions:
- **If negative projection**: Reduce spending or increase income
- **If positive**: Continue current habits or increase savings
- **Low confidence**: Add more transactions for better predictions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Not enough data to generate prediction"
- **Cause**: Less than 1 day of current month data
- **Solution**: Add more transactions for the current month

### "Unable to generate charts"
- **Cause**: Missing matplotlib or data issues
- **Solution**: Ensure matplotlib is installed: `pip install matplotlib>=3.8.0`

### Low Confidence Score
- **Cause**: Few days of data in current month
- **Solution**: Wait for more days to pass or add historical transactions

### Prediction seems inaccurate
- **Cause**: Irregular income/expense patterns
- **Solution**: System improves with more consistent data over time

---

## üìù Notes

- Predictions are based on **historical patterns** and may not account for unexpected events
- **Confidence score** indicates reliability of the prediction
- System works best with **regular transaction logging**
- More data = better predictions
- Review predictions weekly for best results

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **First-time users**: Add at least a week of transactions
2. **Existing users**: Predictions available immediately
3. **Best practice**: Log transactions daily
4. **Check analytics**: Review weekly for insights

## Example Prediction Output

```
üü¢ Great news! Based on your spending patterns, you should comfortably 
   finish the month with a positive balance of $1,234.56.

Confidence Score: 85.7%

üìä Trend: Spending 12% less than last month

Current Balance: $2,500.00
