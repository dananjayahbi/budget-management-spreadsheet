## Usage Guide

### Adding Expenses

1. Navigate to the **Expenses** tab
2. Select transaction type (Expense/Income)
3. Enter the amount and description
4. Select the date using the date picker
5. Add optional notes
6. Click **Save**
7. Transaction will appear color-coded in the table (green for income, red for expense)

### Using Date Filters

In the **Expenses** tab, you can filter transactions by:
- **Today**: Shows only today's transactions

## Troubleshooting

### ML Predictions Not Showing
- Ensure you have transactions in the current month
- At least 1 day of data is required for predictions
- More days = higher confidence scores

### Charts Not Displaying
- Verify matplotlib is installed: `pip install matplotlib>=3.8.0`
- Check that you have transaction history for visualization
- Restart the application if needed

### Application Not Maximizing
- Works on Windows with `root.state('zoomed')`
- For other OS, window will open at 1200x900
